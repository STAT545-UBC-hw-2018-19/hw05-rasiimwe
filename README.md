Goals:

Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
Write some data to file and load it back into R.
Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
Make a plotly visual.
Implement visualization design principles.

To my awesome guests to my repo, please visit [howework1](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-rasiimwe) and [howework2](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw02-rasiimwe/blob/master/hw02.md) for a background on the gapminder dataset. In here I show the exploration, manipulation and analysis of the gapminder dataset. [homework3](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-rasiimwe/blob/master/hw03-rasiimwe.md) will walk you through concepts needed for  data manipulation and exploration using dplyr and the subsequent application of ggplot2 to accomplish data and visualization tasks.
